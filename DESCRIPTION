Description: lpp is an exercise in re-creating the basic functionality 
  of the fangraphs.com auction calculator. This package closely follows the 
  method detailed in a series of blog posts by the "Last Player Picked" website. 
  The aim is to eventually have a Shiny app to input league and calculaion 
  settings.
