#' Example batter and pitcher projections
#' 
#' ATC ROS projections were scraped using gardy::fg_batter_projections() and
#' gardy::fg_pitcher_projections(). They are good representations of the raw 
#' data that will be imported for use in the package. Included here for package 
#' development and testing so the new projections do not need to be scraped each 
#' session.
